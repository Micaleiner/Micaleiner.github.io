                <div class="mbr-section-text mbr-white pb-3 ">
                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">I was born and lived in sunny South Africa until 2014 when my husband and I permanently settled in the beautiful city of Stuttgart, Germany. I have been a member of the Württembergischer Art Association since then.
<br>
<br>From a very young age I loved creating things and naturally picked art as a subject at school, and enrolled for a BA degree in Fine art. After completing the first year I switched my studies to fashion designing and received my diploma.  I started working as designer and eventually owned my own fashion boutique.  I always took big mental leaps and started new things, so that was just a beginning of a very exiting journey that took me to wonderful places, many changes and plenty opportunities.
<br>
<br>The song ‘she's a free and gentle flower growing wild’ relates to me, as I feel deeply and sensitive to others, and are totally addicted to the thrill of creating. I like to put motion and meaning into my work rather than reality. 
<br>
<br>The word ‘diverse’ truly describes my art. My subjects can be anything, from portraits, cityscapes, wild life, flowers as well as the abstract. The subject matter of each piece of work spontaneously determines the materials and the style. I love oil and acrylic paint as a basis but also enjoy waterpaint from time to time. Structure paste, gold leaf and other collage items are often incorporated for the more modern work. The painting seems to come alive with the use of thin, yet visible brush or palette knife strokes, and emphasis are placed on the accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities. 
<br>
<br>Different techniques and styles are used that range from impressionistic, idealistic, expressionistic and abstract. Colours are also incorporated to portray ‘feelings’ - bright colors for happiness, darker colors for sadness.  The abstract work is normally a planned composition that is rational and calm, however the excitement comes from the tension set up between the colors and shapes.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mbr-white display-7">In her oeuvre of recent work, visual artist Mica Leiner, explores the full range of figurative art making. There are several distinct stylistic categories that showcase her unique and diverse style. The range of her visual interpretation includes a personal adaptation of impressionism, atmospheric expressionism and a strong tendency toward abstraction which is particularly evident in the colourful cityscapes and flower studies. 
<br>
<br>The series of iconic portraits reveals a fine sense of observation and portrayal of character, manifesting in a coherent study of personality. These aspects come to the fore successfully in the portraits of Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi. 
<br>
<br>The abstractions reminds one of the contrasting chromatic scale present in the Constructivists and the later 20th century colour Field painters of the USA. 
<br>
<br>This selection of work illustrates a talented artist with a personal point of departure and skillful technical ability. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                               Prominent artist, writer, Louis Jansen van Vuuren's œuvre has gained him recognition throughout South Africa and abroad. In addition to holding more than fifty exhibitions, he has been a lecturer at the university of Cape Town for 26 years (1974 – 2000). He is now living with his partner at their chateau in the French countryside.

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mbr-white display-7">I have admired Marica’s ability to paint, draw and be in command of shape, structure, colour and technique for many years. She was born to be creative and has always produced work of a very high appealing and aesthetic level. The words of Henri Matisse sum her work and approach up quite well “An artist must never be a prisoner of himself, prisoner of style, prisoner of repudiation, prisoner of success, etc.” 
<br>A feeling of emptiness and quietness repeats itself in a number of the artist’s works. The deserted stranded ‘Fishing Boats on shore’ is the best example. The bareness, tranquil and mysterious atmosphere is captivating, almost alluring and enigmatic. Her sensitive brushwork enhances the somber mood of the painting. 
<br>I find the reclining nude ‘Reminiscent’ the most sensual piece. It reminds me of Modigliani’s calm controlling shapes and surfaces, and the simplicity of masterpieces of Matisse’s nudes. Some of her abstract paintings are in direct contrast to this quietness. The movement they capture and radiate is both confusing and energetic. 
<br>The portrait paintings reflect the nobility and dignity of her subjects as well as capture their character. Both Gandhi and Mandela would be proud of her interpretations as it does them great justice in many ways 
<br>Instead of confronting us, her work creates synergy and leaves us with a sense of completeness. As Pablo Picasso said, ‘The purpose of art is to wash the dust of daily life off our souls.’ The chief enemy of creativity is 'good' sense. Her work does that, and is timeless - very few artists achieve that in their lifetime.&nbsp;</p>
